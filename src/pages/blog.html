        <p>codebar began out of recognition that there is a shortage of women, LGBTQ, and people belonging to underrepresented ethnic groups in tech. To help bridge the gap a non-profit initiative was formed that facilitates the growth of a diverse tech community by running regular programming workshops in England. There are 3 large chapters in London and smaller chapters in Brighton, Birmingham and Manchester.</p>
        <p>The workshops are safe environments with coaches agreeing to a code of conduct before teaching that ensures everyone is treated with respect and we approach coding in way that tries not to be daunting or scary.</p>
        <p>Our students come from a variety of backgrounds, some want to become developers and others would simply like to learn the basics of coding in a supportive and social environment. We currently teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git usage and Python, with an aim to expand into other languages at a later point.</p>
        <p>I’ve been helping coordinating Cambridge’s chapter since March this year. Currently we meet about once a month at the <a href="http://makespace.org">Cambridge Makespace</a> / on Wednesday evenings for pizza and social meet up before I pair students off in either 1:1 or 1:2 ratio (e.g 1 coach, 2 students.). The coach and student agree to a structure of what they want to learn on the day. Sometimes is can be as simple as providing advice in tricky part of application or website the student is creating or teaching a series of lessons / tutorials featured on the codebar.io site.</p>
        <p>Coaching can be daunting at first especially if students may be completely new to programming concepts. I’ve found it rewarding because it forces you to explain concepts or ideas out of your normal comfort zone of technical people but to a broader demographic who may or may not have experience .</p>
        <p>Recently ARM has begun sponsoring our sessions with the aim of supporting diversity in a wider landscape. We are currently accepting new students that fit the diversity criteria (<a href="http://codebar.io/student-guide">http://codebar.io/student-guide</a>) and coaches from any background*.</p>

          The generative piece submitted is part of a larger branch of thought I have probably been exploring since stumbling upon Brian Enos generative music in my early 20's. Generative art has been countlessly explored it’s not an unchartered realm, and it makes up lot of daily experience in the form of computer games and what not. In terms of consumerism, it’s getting to the point where I’m wondering if in my lifetime there will be a point where we no longer desire objects but crave systems able to create unique objects? You may argue that this already happens but it’s not to the extent every experience is different or has huge parameters of changes between each experience.</p>
        <p>
          Whilst a lot of social bonds and friendships are between common experience, artifacts, icons but what has always fascinated me is the sheer amount of permutations and random output systems are able to create.</p>
        <p>
          The code (SVG, SASS, Javascript) I’ve created is probably the first time I have written my own very very simple system from scratch rather than relied of other peoples algorithms or programs to generate an image or music. It was quite refreshing to not just set the small things that define the limits of what is created but actually set something up that creates the whole experience. As it’s super simple I’m hoping others can look at the code and see how its all put together and define there own starting color and then hammer the button a few times and generate a variety of different options.</p>
        <p>
          I expect I will probably create something much larger with SVG in the near distance future or maybe some kind of larger graphic generative experience.</p>
