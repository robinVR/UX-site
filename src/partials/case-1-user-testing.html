    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <h4>I tested the usability of my prototype with a pool of 10 engineers. This included: software engineers, a hardware engineers and technical authors. </h4>
    <p>Each user was asked to perform common documentation UI browsing and interaction tasks, their response was captured on video.</p>

    <h4>The results</h4>
    <p>Through examination of the results we began to notice a behaviors indicating difficulties in specific interface elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Locating the toggle version button.</li>
      <li>Difficulties in browsing and finding 4th level topics.</li>
      <li>Minor difficulties in recognizing menu hierarchy.</li>
      <li>Minor difficulties in finding the PDF version of a Document.</li>
      <li>Minor difficulties in understanding content heading hierarchy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In total 70% of users were able to complete the test without difficulty.</p>

    <h2>User testing round 2</h2>
    <h4>Subsequent retesting yielded a higher pass rate of usability for all of the usability tests.
    </h4>
    <p>I also ran an A/B test to help determine via heat map where users were clicking on each of the prototypes. </p>
    <p>The higher heat around the UI on prototype 2 confirmed that more users were interacting with the Menu than the previous prototype. This would not necessarily confirm that the usability was <em>better</em> but that it was encouraging more interaction.</p>

      <h4 class="highlight"><em>90% of users passed all usability tests on the 2nd round of user testing.</em></h4></blockquote>
